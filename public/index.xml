      <description>This is part one of the Boolean Logic and Gates series.
Worthy to think George Boole may actually be the grandfather of the digital world.
Brief Overview Boolean Logic is quintessential to the field of computer science and programming in general. It is an integral component and foundational cornerstone to the way digital circuits are constructed and data is manipulated.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been revisting a lot of content concerning Boolean Logic.</description>

      <title>Unspoken Flaws of Dynamic Languages</title>

      <guid>https://geraldmokereke.xyz/posts/unspoken-flaws-of-dynamic-languages/</guid>
      <description>Disclaimer: Possible rant session.
Introduction I decided to write this essay after the recent rebuttals from the Vanilla JavaScript community towards Typescript — Typecasting, Typesafety — call it whatever you wish.
A lot of people who got into programming probably began with dynamic programming languages — such as Ruby, PHP, Perl, and Python, for example. Hence, being their &amp;ldquo;first love,&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s really hard trying to convince them that those languages may not be the best choice for large codebases where a lot of collaboration is needed.</description>

      <description>The Binary Abacus An abacus was one of the earliest computing devices created that was used to perform the four basic operations in mathematics — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
In this article, we are going to be designing a binary abacus from scratch using C++
This program will be CLI/Terminal based. We would not need any GUI software necessary to begin. I got interested by stumbling across the video below:</description>

      <description>This article was created because of my guy, Collins Ikotun, my vim convert! Also, I use vim btw.
When I started off programming I really had a very wrong perception of a &amp;ldquo;development environment&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;development setup.&amp;rdquo; This led to me, eventually wanting to do the most. Effectively creating an amazing workflow to most people with very much reduced productivity. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realise that a development setup isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily spawning an ultra wide $5,000 monitor.</description>

      <description>The performance of mobile applications is extremely important. Users want a seamless experience with almost no bugs or glitches — to save yourself the violent reviews your mobile app would get on the app stores. Or preferably reduce? Because haters will hate.
JavaScript is arguably a performant language naturally. It&amp;rsquo;s the pinnacle of all web applications that run on the client. A modern day functioning app cannot exist without shipping JavaScript modules to the client.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s solve the shortest path problem
Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to be solving the shortest path problem by implementing Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s algorithm with some Python. So get a cup of coffee and a neovim buffer opened, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a ride.
What is the shortest path problem? Before we begin, we must first understand what is the shortest path problem. The shortest path problem is a fundamental optimization problem in computer science, speficifically graph theory under discrete mathematics or data structures and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Nigeria is A failed State: What Next?</title>

      <guid>https://geraldmokereke.xyz/posts/a-failed-state-what-next/</guid>
      <description>Officially a failed state, what next?
Nigeria&amp;rsquo;s situation is a laughable one. Imagine being led by a president who has quite a disturbing criminal record history.
Then, a vice president who allegedly has had dealings with Boko Haram.
Or the current Chief of Staff to the president select, a former head of the House of Representatives who was a convicted criminal in the United States.
Yikes.
Then, much recently, they appointed a criminal who looted Rivers&amp;rsquo; state wealth and participated in the rigging of the elections on the President Select&amp;rsquo;s request, Nyesom Wike, as the Minister of Abuja.</description>

      <guid>https://geraldmokereke.xyz/posts/do-not-call-me-techbro/</guid>
      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t call me &amp;ldquo;Tech bro.&amp;rdquo;
I was handing over a document I printed out, highlighting the several suggestions and feature requests I made concerning an existing application, and then I was called the TB word.
Infuriating to say, &amp;ldquo;Tech Bro&amp;rdquo; is not something I&amp;rsquo;d like to be called or I&amp;rsquo;d like to address someone as. It&amp;rsquo;s already disgusting how a serious discipline is consolidated into the word &amp;ldquo;tech,&amp;rdquo; which influencers are tweeting around for a payout from X.</description>

      <guid>https://geraldmokereke.xyz/posts/neovim-is-overrated/</guid>
      <description>Neovim is actually overrated. I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the buzz with some lua scripted, terminal based editor, which is a Vim rip-off. Which same human being hits &amp;ldquo;gg&amp;rdquo; to go to the top of a line, and &amp;ldquo;ggVG&amp;rdquo; with case sensitivity in mind to select all content?
Hold up. I got you in the first paragraph, didn&amp;rsquo;t I? Neovim is a pretty cool Vim based editor that I still can not understand why people may hate on or have misgivings about it.</description>

      <description>There are so much vulnerable men in the world. Men do have feelings. But they deny. Heck, we deny. The rise of so much “red pill” podcasts and part-time sex-traffickers, girlfriend beating, chinless men like Andrew Tate or proven miscreant turned saviour, Sneako, with a cult following of young vulnerable men is worrisome. Why is this so, you may ask? Well, it’s really hard to say.
Why bad representations exist. I genuinely believe the reason for the success of the aforementioned platforms and individuals is because men deep down are looking for a voice, otherwise firm figure to endorse and represent their patriarchal beliefs.</description>

      <description>Johan Cruyff is regarded as one of the greatest players and coaches of all time. He is remembered for the very attractive, unique technical approach to football he employed at Barcelona, which he inherited from Rinus Michels&amp;rsquo; ideology at Ajax.
This is why Ajax, historically, would forever be an essential piece to modern-day football.
Cruyff took the idea to Barcelona where he developed it. By carrying the Dutch philosophy or Ajax system to Barcelona, he also inspired other coaches at that time in Spain to adopt the philosophy.</description>

      <description>Introduction. In this article, I will walk you through the entire process of dockerizing a Spring Boot application, and connecting it to a PostgreSQL database which would be spun up in a seperate container. I assume you have a little knowledge of Docker. I initially planned to do a Docker tutorial. I think at the time of writing this&amp;ndash;I have a draft on medium about it. Expect an article soon based on Docker.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Matplotlib. Matplotlib is a library used to create visualisations of data in the Python programming language. With matplotlib, you can create two-dimensional graphs using Python Scripts. It’s pretty cool and I will be showing you how you could use it for your subsequent projects, research and schoolwork alongside the Jupyter Notebook tool.
Jupyter Notebooks. A Jupyter Notebook is a locally hosted web application used for machine learning and data science tasks, which involves writing models, documenting models and visualising their implementation with tools such as Matplotlib or Seaborn (an alternative).</description>

      <description>Introduction. In this article you would learn how to properly structure and craft decent, intuitive and readable commit messages that summarise the context of the code you published to either a remote or local branch of a repository. This would be helpful if you work on collaborative projects, and would also save you the mental stress of trying to figure out a commit. I was once guilty of creating incredibly confusing and inappropriate commit messages, that did not capture the context of my code.</description>

      <description>Introduction This article will cover the topic of application programming interfaces, which is an essential unit that makes up the microservice architecture.
The Microservice Architecture. The micro service architecture is a type of application architecture where the application is broken into several units, communicating effectively with each other over a network protocol. In contrast to monolith applications, which contains the entire logic, client side and server side units in one package that is deployed on a server.</description>

      <description>Introduction There is an awful lot that goes into writing good code that abides by proper Object-Oriented Programming principles. In this tutorial I will basically cover the importance and significance of writing quality code (though I feel that quality code is subjective) thereby avoding &amp;ldquo;Oops in Oop.&amp;rdquo;
Note: &amp;ldquo;Oops&amp;rdquo; is basically an exclamation made after a significant mistake or accident rather.
Getting Started Before being able to follow this tutorial and get the best out of it, you have to meet up with the following perquisites.</description>

      <description>How to set up Laravel with React JS. Introduction. Just like I was roaming Stackoverflow, you’ve probably been wondering how to set up React JS with the Laravel framework. React is arguably one of the most powerful libraries for building user-interfaces. Yes, it’s a library, not really a framework. It forms the view component of web applications. Laravel on the other hand, is a powerful open-source PHP framework used for building small to robust web applications.</description>

      <description>Introduction This article covers the concept of Fibonacci series. A very popular algorithm in Computer Science. We would be implementing the theory practically in the C programming language.
Italian Mathematician, Fibonacci. What is the Fibonacci Series? The Fibonacci series is a unique set of series whereby the following term is always equal to the sum of the previous two terms. We could reframe this explanation in another perspective. We could refer to these series as a growing array or set of numbers where the previous sum of two terms is the determinant of the next term.</description>

      <description>Introduction. In this article, I will guide you through the processes I went through to create an image classifier using the Flask framework, the Keras library and Google&amp;rsquo;s popular machine learning library, Tensorflow. It was quite an interesting project that managed to gain over nineteen stars on Github, as at the time of writing this article. I was really pleased with the project, thus I humbly decided to share the entire workflow.</description>
