<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This article was written on the 24th of November 2019. Prior to my first term
examinations in the 11th grade. During my tenure in high school. I have always been
fascinated with AI. This article encompasses the field of Artificial Intelligence, and the several approaches applied. It is a quite an elaborate but decent summary of the topic targeted towards enthusiasts like myself, both beginners and intermediate learners, or persons who would love to get a grasp of this trending technology and what it actually entails.</p>
<h3 id="brief-overview">Brief Overview</h3>
<p>The term Artificial Intelligence, abbreviated as (AI) in many cases, has become
exceptionally synonymous with the technological ecosystem, advanced research in
computer science and various interdisciplinary fields of theoretical computer science,
robotic engineering and data science. A technology once perceived as an object,
otherwise concept, of contemporary science fiction movies and material, is gradually
becoming supported and endorsed as the essential pivot into spearheading the next
revolution in human civilization after the era of mechanical industrialization.</p>
<h3 id="alan-turing-ais-proponent">Alan Turing: AI’s Proponent</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Alan Turing (1912-1954)</a>, an acclaimed British computer scientist and logician
proposed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">“Turing Test”</a> which became the basis, of which Artificial Intelligence as
a field of study was built on. He proposed a thesis which outlined the human
biological brain, as a biochemical computing machine. Turing is attributed as one of
the most influential figures in the field of AI and theoretical biology of which he is a
founding father.</p>
<h3 id="the-turing-test">The Turing Test</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Turing Test</a>, a thesis which serves as the principal building block of Artificial
Intelligence, described further as the imitation game, is defined as the ability of a
machine to exhibit indistinguishable human level intelligence or behavior If a machine
and human were evaluated based on responses that would be hardly
indistinguishable, such machine is said to have “passed” the Turing test. Turing in his
1950 publication, titled: “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, posed an</p>
<p>unambiguous question, on if machines would be able to think. He further went ahead
to debate and argue on the context of machines being able to perform cognitive
functions, outlining certain possibilities. Despite being a good thesis to judge or define a machine&rsquo;s “intelligence”, it is however, not a proficient method to analyze or
evaluate a machine’s level of intelligence, as it is generally theorized on exhibiting
human like characteristics and behavior. While we could however, create a solid
relationship between human level intelligence, and a machine displaying human level
intelligence, we cannot however ascertain to what degree. The Turing test only tests if
the machine behaves like a human being.</p>
<h3 id="the-turing-test-limits-context-weaknesses">The Turing Test: Limits, context, weaknesses.</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the Turing Test ignores consciousness which is a key factor to
ascertaining if a machine can ”think.” The Turing test is clearly concerned with
external characteristics demonstrated, ignoring other aspects such as self
consciousness. It employs more of a behavioral approach to the mind. Despite the
clear loopholes in the thesis, it has been pivotal to the development of the popular
CAPTCHA systems used on websites to determine if the user accessing a session is
human, by generating numbers, wriggled text, distorted images, or images with
certain objects recognized by the system. If the user is able to choose from the array of images for example, for which contains the object stated, they are allowed to proceed.</p>
<p>This is a demonstration of the Turing Test in a reverse manner to prevent automated
systems, malicious bot scripts and spam programs from accessing secure platforms.
The Turing Test should not be mistaken for the &ldquo;Turing Complete&rdquo; concept, which is a
classification of data manipulation rules.</p>
<h3 id="consciousness-as-a-pillar-of-true-ai">Consciousness: As a pillar of True AI</h3>
<p>In order for a machine to think or perform tasks without being supervised with
human level intelligence, we could affirm that consciousness is a key element that is
required. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Consciousness</a> is referred to as awareness. It is a state whereby an individual
is aware and able to perceive his environment to take actions. Consciousness
contributes to the receptacle of mortality, life and beliefs. Full consciousness’
implementation in artificial intelligence as a subject matter has however been
observed as a paradox in many case studies.
Could human level consciousness eventually conform to artificial intelligence as a
field? If such is attained, it simply means the acceptance of mortality, orthodox beliefs and several other components that could be attributed to our consciousness as
humans. The instinct for survival as well, even though these machines or devices do
not require organic resources to function. It’s indeed a belief which could be likened to a myth or fiction.</p>
<h3 id="artificial-intelligence-the-current-state">Artificial Intelligence: The current state</h3>
<p>The Artificial Intelligence that is being implemented as of today could however be
defined as “primitive” in nature, in contrast to the ideologies and beliefs we have
gained from various resources and fictional content. Isaac Asimov’s I, Robot novel has
served as a massive impact on the ethics of artificial intelligence. Despite being
fictional, it has set up a standard which if attained and when explained, could be
referred to as human level intelligence by machines or advanced intelligence.
Primitive describes the level of Artificial Intelligence today, despite the available tools, applications, approaches, resources and investment on infrastructure used to scale and implement several trained models. Computers in nature were historically
designed to execute certain actions, such as mathematical evaluations and tasks,
within time. The reason for the development of computers, or computing machines
could be ascribed to the early B.C, during the time when counting devices were
invented. Computing machines were designed not just to execute tasks, but to store
certain information, sort and process data effectively, far beyond the barriers of the
human mind and cognitive capabilities. In layman’s terms, computers presently are
not as a matter of fact “intelligent” and as of the time this article was published,
cannot pass the Turing Test on an all round basis.
Despite Artificial Intelligence, being relatively primitive, there has been certain
attention given to it in the recent years, as private research organizations and
individuals in the academia, devise appropriate methods, and means to escalate and
improve the approaches towards creating intelligent machines. We could draw a
relationship between the human mind, and computer software to the human body
and computer hardware respectively. Computer software has seen massive
improvements, as many standard algorithms, and outdated means of sorting data, are
being effectively ruled out. Machine Learning has become a major approach to
attaining primitive level artificial intelligence and advancing software systems and
applications. By employing computational and statistical models, machine learning
has grown to become one of the most significant approaches and sub-disciplinary
field of AI and Data Science.</p>
<h3 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h3>
<p>Machine Learning is the application of algorithms, to enable a computer learn from
provided datasets. Although I have written another article which gives a more
elaborate explanation on machine learning, in order to illustrate machine learning
simply, we would use the below image:</p>

        title="Machine Learning" /></p>
<p>Machine Learning as an approach, could be related to how living organisms are able
to learn from their external environment, and function based on recently acquired
facts, or knowledge. This is because as aforementioned above in a section of this
article, I described the state and purpose of computing devices. Referencing the early
age of computation and drawing a relativity, due to the fact that as of today, modern
day computers are designed to only execute tasks based on the data or instructions
passed. Computers, in a metaphorical sense when compared to humans, cannot
exhibit or take actions on their own, based on their perception. In order to make this a
possibility, machine learning is used to train a model to learn from provided data. It is
a statistical approach, that could be likened to feeding a child with information from
various sources, to enable the child gain knowledge, as to decide and take
independent actions in certain circumstances. There are three different types of</p>
<p>machine learning. Otherwise learning classifications under Machine Learning. These
are: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I
would however, supply a brief overview on the above classifications except for
reinforcement learning.</p>
<h3 id="supervised-learning">Supervised Learning</h3>
<p>Supervised learning utilizes labeled training data sets to learn the implemented
mapping function that converts input variables represented by $(X)$ to an output
variable represented by $(Y)$. It solves for the value of f in the sample equation; $Y=f(X)$. Where $f$ represents the mapping function. Regression and classification are products,
otherwise demonstrations of the concept of supervised learning which would be
covered in a separate paper: Regression in Supervised Learning. These models are
utilized to predict data from a set of input variables. Regression is applied to objects, and real values, while the latter is applied to categorical data. A regression model from samples could predict the following, for instance: The length of an object and speed of a computer. The latter could be used to predict certain labels, such as
intelligent, genius or stupid.</p>
<h3 id="unsupervised-learning">Unsupervised Learning</h3>
<p>These models are implemented when there are available input variables within a
provided dataset, but the absence of corresponding or related output variables.
Concepts such as clustering could be used to group sample objects within a collection
(cluster) are very much similar to each other than to the objects from a different cluster or collection of data, is a popular concept of unsupervised learning. Association another method classified under unsupervised learning could also be utilized to predict the probability of a co-occurrence in a particular data set. An example of association, is a model that could perform a task such as: <em>“If Gerald purchases computers within the corei7 processor range, he would fancy a fast phone as well.”</em></p>
<h3 id="artificial-neural-networks">Artificial Neural Networks</h3>
<p>These are generally the methods applied in machine learning today, with simple
references and real life implementations. Another acknowledged approach towards
artificial intelligence which I find really fascinating is Deep Learning which is
conceptualized on the application of Artificial Neural Networks also known as ANNs.
A computer model of interlinked nodes, or layers which is inspired by the biological
human brain, is preferably the best description in layman’s terms, that I could give.
Biological neural networks have been known to constitute the human brain, and
artificial neural networks in turn, have been designed to implement similar
parameters by the biological brain in order for machines to exhibit human level
intelligence, learn, and work with a given set of data. Artificial Neural Networks
began as an approach to exploit the underlying architecture of the human brain to
provide high level solutions to problems that conventional or standard computer
algorithms were far limited to tackling or providing solutions to. Artificial Neural
Networks, have been utilized heavily in facial recognition, text recognition, object
recognition and computer vision as a whole. ANNs could be applied to observe,
identify microscopic bodies and cancerous cells, under a microscope with no
supervision to the level of a trained professional, and pose a suitable diagnosis based
on its findings or data collected.</p>

<p>The MLP should not be mistaken of the SLP (single layer perceptron) model that
possesses just the input and output layers respectively.</p>
<p>I stumbled across the concepts of Neural Networks, a month before I began to write
this article, after learning about the Pydmb library, inspired by Goeffery Hinton’s
Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) which I would cover in a separate article. The
Boltzmann machine however is a powerful stochastic neural network model and
algorithm that could be implemented for classification, regression, collaborative
filtering and dimensionality reduction. Which I also detailed on how it could be
utilized for predictive analysis, supervision of classifiers for blood samples in
transfusion. To enable better clarifications, I will proceed to state and explain a few of the various types of neural networks today, giving a brief overview on the underlying
principles behind each of its respective architecture and its implementation. They are:
Radial Basis Function Neural Network, Modular Neural Network, Recurrent Neural
Network, Feed Forward Neural Networks, Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network
(illustrated in the above diagram) and Covolutional Neural Network. In this specific
article we will review three of the popularly used models.</p>
<h3 id="covolutional-neural-networks">Covolutional Neural Networks</h3>
<p>The most preferable neural network utilized in the field of image processing in
artificial intelligence is the Covolutional Neural Network model. This model can be
used in the field of computer vision as there are implementations of CNNs in
computer vision libraries in Open CV, which I attempted as a hobby project in C++
because computer vision library supports three dimensional matrices. The CNN
contains layers which are responsible for the extraction of data from images, which
assigns unique values to the images that are later utilized for proper identification.
The model implements a customized matrix, to convolute over the images and
produce a map. This custom matrix is triggered in a random manner and updated by
the means of backpropagation. Backpropagation is also known as backward
propagation of errors, and is a system of tuning the weights of the model to reduce the
error rates and improve it’s efficiency. It helps to calculate a gradient of a loss function with respect to all the weights in the network. A pooling layer is responsible for the collation and aggregation of the maps produced on the convolutional layer.</p>
<h3 id="feed-forward-network">Feed Forward Network</h3>
<p>The feed forward neural network, is a model that features output and input neurons
connected to each other and a hidden layers. As the name implies, the data moves
forward in one direction alone, and thus is referred to as feed forward networks.
Hidden layers are not always present in the model depending on it’s implementation.
In this system, there is an absence of the backpropagation system in several cases.
There is no backpropagation, therefore the weights in the model cannot be updated,
whereas the more perceptron layers, defines the capacity of the model to learn to a
higher degree. The feed forward networks are used in speech recognition, face
recognition and classification.</p>
<h3 id="recurrent-neural-networks">Recurrent Neural Networks</h3>
<p>A recurrent neural network model, is an algorithm that implements series of data or
sequential data. These models are utilized to recognize certain patterns in a data
sequence, which includes and is not limited to; spoken language and written text.
They function based on the training data supplied and are incorporated into several
systems responsible for natural language processing and neural machine translation.
Unlike other artificial neural networks, they share the same weights on each node, in
contrast to feed forward neural networks, that has distributed weights across the
nodes. Recurrent Neural Networks rely on backpropagation through a
Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) model or algorithm, to determine gradients
which is a clear contrast to the standard backpropagation, since the above method is
applicable and associated to sequence data. The RNNs sum up errors while feed
forward networks do not, since they do not share equally distributed weights or
parameters.
Artificial Neural Networks, through the creation of multiple models, has proven to be
one of the best approaches towards Artificial Intelligence, in deep learning. Neural
Networks model complex relationships between data. Although logic, probabilistic
theory and approaches combined with statistics, is a another approach to AI, which is
referred to as the Bayes Network, otherwise Bayesian network, we will not review
this, as it heavily involves graphical models, probability theory and mathematical
models that may span beyond this article. Overall to deploy these statistical machine
learning or neural network models, it requires high computing power, depending on
the capacity and size of the model.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-of-artificial-intelligence">The future of Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
<p>Since AI as a technology can be described as primitive and narrow currently,
however, there are bigger plans as it concerns this technology, which includes
spanning into various fields and sectors such as healthcare, finance and agriculture to
improve the overall infrastructure currently employed.</p>
<h3 id="cognitive-machines">Cognitive Machines</h3>
<p>Cognition, can be defined as the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and
understanding through thought, experience, and the senses. Therefore we can attribute
the concept of cognitive machines or devices as a building block of futuristic on
Turing’s proposition, on if machines can actually think.</p>
<h3 id="superintelligence">Superintelligence</h3>
<p>The human brain has naturally imposed limits. Although psychologists have proven
that there is no standard limit to our cognitive abilities, because we only use ten percent
of our brains, we could however, from a different perspective, address this as a limit.
The human brain’s memory capacity in an average person is able to store trillions of
bytes of information, despite the “ten percent” limitation. The average processing speed
of the human brain is sixty bits per second. The fastest bit processing speed attained by
an individual was recorded at seventy-three bits per second. This I find quite amusing
considering the earliest versions of computer ran at a hundred and ten bits per minutes,
now we also have microprocessors running at thousands of bits per second. A super
intelligent machine would possess intelligence and processing speed that would
surpass the most brilliant mind. Many believe that if a true AI system is developed, it
would proceed to rewrite and modify itself, which would be a recursive self
improvement.</p>
<h3 id="robotics-and-automation">Robotics and Automation</h3>
<p>Simply put, the future of Artificial Intelligence encompasses advanced robotics.
Currently, robots developed are no different from our available micro computers,
generally because these systems exhibit no general independence and must be fed or
instructed on what to do, to achieve a specific task. With advanced AI systems, these
machines would become a host to the software, and would be controlled based on the
beliefs, thoughts and ideas of the software. Robotics I believe, futuristically would be
used to grant a significant form of expression to such software. Machines would be able
to possess artificial organs, such as eyes, that utilize computer vision and heavy image
processing administered by a compelling neural network too classify, recognize images in their environment. If this is attained, artificial sight or sight exhibited by robots, would be achieved. This is because the human brain plays a very important role in sight. As it is responsible for decoding certain images and processing them into a
person’s consciousness or mind. Advanced Automation in factories, would be
employed such that, machines would be able to tackle any defunct device, component,
facility, object or infrastructure if the system notices an issue, unlike most machines that adhere strictly to a specific algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="the-fears-or-risk-of-this-technology">The fears or risk of this Technology?</h3>
<p>I find it difficult to understand the unnecessary doomsday scenarios being proposed so
early on Artificial Intelligence. Futuristic AI would sufficiently provide dynamic and
compelling solutions to research, healthcare and various other sectors that would be
pivotal to our advancement and growth as modern day civilization. Hence, why
propagate theories of existential threat, when AI at its current state can only be
classified as primitive, the fact being it is nowhere close to the concept of super
intelligent AI?</p>
<h3 id="existential-threat">Existential Threat</h3>
<p>I would preferably say AI would become a significantly existential threat due to the
advent of advanced robotics, or granting these systems administrative access or
privileges to the web, whereas by that time, multiple systems and automated devices
would be connected to the internet as a singular resource to improve sharing of
resources between internet devices. This would only be worth bothering about when
super intelligent AI systems are built, which results on possibly exhibiting convergent
behavior to acquire the sufficient resources to fulfill and impending task that was
decided upon the system itself. Many philosophers, argue that the AI system could
acquire resources to prevent itself from being shut down. Generally speaking, many
believe the AI may feel inferior to the human race, intimidated and threatened,
therefore try to evict or subdue it, as a reflex action to ensure its safety. I am among
those who believe that consciousness is a key factor to this ever occurring which
includes advanced cognition. However, the massive progress that has been made in the
field of research AI has been exceptionally theoretical, and not easily applicable. In
order to prevent existential threat, the research, study and development of AI systems
should be supervised and regulated.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-weaponry-advanced-digital-warfare">Advanced Weaponry, Advanced digital warfare</h3>
<p>I was asked questioned once on my belief about AI being a destructive technology and I
stated it only is, in the “wrong hands” or people. AI originated from scientific research,
philosophical beliefs and was propounded the more by scientific fiction, which also
contributed to the goals of furthering the development of the field. Although a vast
majority of the resources being spent and infrastructure being developed for good
causes and implementation of AI, it could be utilized as a blueprint or key to creating
advanced weaponry which could unfortunately spearhead an unwanted warfare. As of
2015, several countries were reported to be researching and developing battlefield
robots. Despite AI tools being implemented by governments to locate, search, survey
and predict any threats, as the cost of Artificial Intelligence tools decreases, and
becomes easier to understand overtime, this would become dangerous in the hands of
wrong persons, governments or criminals.</p>
<h3 id="technological-unemployment">Technological Unemployment</h3>
<p>Most economists argue that the introduction of AI would lead to unemployment, as it is
already replacing certain jobs with automation. This could spell immense laziness from
unskilled individuals. The labour force could be classified into three segments, the
unskilled, semi skilled and skilled. AI poses a threat to the unskilled and semi skilled
labour force already, despite not being as advanced, as automated systems could easily
handle most, to all tasks in the two aforementioned segments with greater proficiency.
So I do agree, that an impending threat of AI, is unemployment.</p>
<p>For the advantages and goals of Artificial Intelligence, it seems endless, as this article would not be able to address effectively. Aspects such as; reduction in human errors, which was pivotal to the development of self driving cars to ensure greater accuracy when driving to reduce the number of automobile accidents, as well as in research and
study, digital assistance, faster decisions, prediction models being utilized to predict
malignant growth in a woman’s breast at early stages are some advantages of AI. It has
no limitations and could work, handle and execute tasks within any hour of the day,
preventing delays. AI would help reduce the number of persons and resources required
to handle certain things, and would simplify our daily lives to the highest level.
It is a no-brainer why this technology is further being developed and improved due to
the immense benefits. Even though the cost of implementation and infrastructure to
deploy and apply these models is quite high, it decreases a little by each year, which is a good sign of progress. The hardware designed to run and execute these models are
being effectively improved upon as well. Most companies are developing accelerated
hardware devices to manage these models and implementing liquid cooling
infrastructure in their data centers to compliment the speed, and efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The trend, on AI being generated is certainly worth it, as I dived into the essence of the technology, applications, approaches, brief overview, philosophical notes, theoretical applications, very brief history, the proponent and covered a few concepts in detail, simplifying these terms which I believe would be presentable to any reader. Artificial Intelligence is the future, and the future is Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>Forgive my naivety and ignorance. I know I am in no way competent to deliver my jurisdictions or propositions on the above subject matter at this time.</p>
