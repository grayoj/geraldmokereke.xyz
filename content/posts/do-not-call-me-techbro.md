Don't call me "Tech bro."

I was handing over a document I printed out, highlighting the several suggestions and feature requests I made concerning an existing application, and then I was called the TB word.

Infuriating to say, "Tech Bro" is not something I'd like to be called or I'd like to address someone as. It's already disgusting how a serious discipline is consolidated into the word "tech," which influencers are tweeting around for a payout from X.

Sighs, nevertheless. Do I look like a Tech Bro? I avoid the generic "Tech Bro" outlook. I keep a basic hairstyle, I do like to wear a lot of collared shirts sometimes with cufflinks and throw in a suit sometimes to woo the engineering girls.

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I couldn't care less, I am terrible, I mean terrible with women.

Sorry for deviating. This fellow had no idea he had violated me. Tech bro, you say?
Firstly, what happened to your shallow vocabulary brother. Dev? Developer? Programmer? You don't understand or know these words? 

Human beings, funny species of bipedal apes in the end.
