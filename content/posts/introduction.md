# Welcome to Gray's Notes.

I have a little note to drop proceeding the creation of this site. You are about to behold, sacred content - carved from the most reliable resources on the planet and my brain of course.
Peril to thee, who assumes this blog is subjected to computers alone. It is a piece of entertainment to the fanatics of computers, but also a platform of expression, research, ideologies and beliefs spanning
through several fields of science, technology, engineering, faith and poetry!

### Oath of Allegiance

- I pledge not to indulge in excess hate speech.
- I pledge to show in every way I am geek or nerd worthy to read through sacred content.

- I will not shit on the PHP programming language.
- I shall always prefer React to the Angular framework.

So help me God. Thank You.
